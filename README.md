# AIML-in-digital-forensics
A research overview paper submitted as a final project in CS 565 Advanced Digital Forensics @ UMass during Spring 2025.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the rise of AI/ML use as part of a digital forensic investigator's toolbox, and the new types of concerns that these technologies bring to the field of digital forensics in the form of new digital artifacts, and potentially as part of "anti-forensic" malware.

This repo contains the full paper and slideshow presentation regarding this research.

### Artificial Intelligence in Digital Forensics: Augmented Analysis and Emerging Evidence
#### By Albi Marini, Danny Trainor

**Introduction**
The field of digital forensics is ever-evolving, constantly seeing new sophisticated threats with increasing amounts of data to analyze. Manual analysis has become a thing of the past in this modern era, as digital forensic analysts are relying more and more on artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies for their investigations. Professionals in the field have touted how these technologies “amplify the efficiency and precision of digital forensic investigations”. (Dunsin et al., 2024) Many popular tools now integrate AI & ML to help the identification, collection, and analysis steps of the forensic process (Hagan, D. K., 2021). At the same time. The rise of AI technology in consumer products has resulted in new types of digital “artifacts”, like AI-generated or “genAI” images and logs of large language model (LLM) agent prompts that can be used as evidence (Yin et al., 2025).

Our paper aims to explore these two themes of the role of artificial intelligence in digital forensics:
How LLMs and other AI tools are enhancing and creating new digital forensic tools across storage, network, and volatile memory analysis
And
How AI-generated artifacts constitute a new realm of digital forensic evidence, with challenges emerging in their reliability in an investigation

By examining widely used tools like Magnet AXIOM, Darktrace, and Cellebrite Pathfinder as well as conducting a review of recent scholarly papers regarding the topic, we aim to highlight the capabilities that the AI boom has added to digital forensics, as well as identify the risks associated with these innovations.
